        It is the year 2013. I graduated from the Dayton Regional STEM School in Ohio and decided to pursue a career as a linguist in the United States Air Force. Sadly,
        it did not work out, so I was transitioned over to a 3D0X2, which is a Cyber Systems Operator or, simply put, a system administrator. During my tenure at Shaw Air Force Base,
        located in Sumter South Carolina, I swiftly acquired an advanced skillset which allowed me to make my mark in my squadron; this allowed me to revamp the training systems in place to efficiently
        train future Airmen. Fast forward to 2019, I decided to not renew my contract with the military, seeking greener pastures, so I moved to San Antonio, Texas. There I sought employment
        with SMS Data Solutions as a Senior Helpdesk Specialist. My prior experiences working with the military allowed me to seamlessly integrate myself with current systems to provide excellent
        support and coverage for our customers. Unfortunately, this is where I began to feel the stagnation. Did I really want to be a general IT my whole life where the only promotion was to become a manager?

          Hello, I am Jeremiah Ross, Senior Airman, providing surperior support for a Global Area Network. <br><br>
          It is now the year 2019. I found a job opportunity for a specialized service desk, which supports a cyber defense and detection toolkit; it is a far cry from generic 
          administrative work. Although it was a struggle at first, I transitioned from a fast-paced, on-your-feet-all-day role handling 20-50 tickets daily to a slower, 
          more focused, and in-depth position. This is where I first got a taste of working in a development environment. I am learning about the toolkit, from the basics of setting 
          it up to the advanced skills of using and interpreting the data it captures. These are all essential skills I must acquire to effectively assist my new customers in their 
          day-to-day activities. The product has its ebbs and flows but I love it. I am the first group to touch anything new, working hand in hand with developers, tech writers, 
          and even product managers to build, test, and tear down the product. It is now 2024 and I desire more. The feeling of stagnation of working at a service desk is real. I 
          want to be the creator. I want my hands in the guts of a product. Thus, I begin my journey into becoming a developer.

          Hello, I am Jeremiah Ross, I am seeking more, a future, a lifestyle. <br><br>
          Single, with two cats, and unwilling to spend the rest of my life in debt to a college or university? Time to look at bootcamps. I will admit I had been casually searching 
          for bootcamps for a while as becoming a developer was something I wanted to explore. However, the fear of the cost, the potential unemployment period, and the possibility 
          of failure had always held me back. With the added stress of the pandemic which caused many bootcamps to shrink down or even disappear, I was terrified. Thankfully, I found 
          Turing during one of my searches and learned they took the GI Bill; this assuaged my fears of cost and debt. I had the most amazing time at Turing as the courses were fleshed 
          out and the instructors very capable. Now with real world experience, I feel I am completely prepared to finally, fully, and completely enter the world of developers.
