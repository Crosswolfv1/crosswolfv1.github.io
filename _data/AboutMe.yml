        Hello, I am Jeremiah Ross, fresh graduate from high school ready to make my mark on the world! <br><br>
        It is the year 2013, I graduated from the Dayton Regional STEM School in Ohio, and I decided to pursue a career as a linguist in the United States Air Force.
        Sadly, that didn't work out, so I was transitioned over to a 3D0X2, a Cyber Systems Operator, or just a system admin. During my tenure at Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter South Carolina, I swiftly acquired 
        an advanced skillset that allowed me to make my mark at my squadron, allowing me to revamp the training systems that were in place to efficiently train future Airmen. 
        Fast forward to 2019 I decide to not renew my contract with the military, seeking greener pastures I move to San Antonio, Texas where I seek employment with SMS Data Solutions, as a Senior Helpdesk Specialist, with
        my experiences working with military prior this allows me so seemlessly integrate myself with current systems to provide excellent support and coverage for our customers. Unfortunately this is where
        I began to feel the stagnation. Did I really want to be general IT my whole life, where the only promotion was to become a manager?

          Hello, I am Jeremiah Ross, Senior Airman, providing surperior support for a Global Area Network. <br><br>
          It is now the year 2019, I find a job opportunity for a specialized service desk, supporting a cyber defense and detection toolkit, a far cry from generic admin work. It is a struggle at first, going from a fast paced, all day on your feet, 20-50 tickets a day role, to a slower, focused, in depth role. This is where I first get the taste of working in a developer
          environment. I am learning about the toolkit, from the basics of how to set it up to the advanced of how to use and read the data it captures, all things that I must gain skill in to assist my new customers in their day to day activities.
          The product has its ebbs and flows, and I am loving it, being the first group to touch anything new, working hand in hand with developers, tech writers, even product managers to build, test, and tear down the product.
          It is now 2024 and I desire more, the feeling of stagnation of working a service desk is real, I want to be the creator, I want my hands in the guts of a product, and thus I begin my journey, into becoming a developer.

          Hello, I am Jeremiah Ross, I am seeking more, a future, a lifestyle. <br><br>
          Single, have 2 cats, don't want to spend the rest of my life in debt to a College or a University? Time to look at bootcamps, now I will admit I had been casually searching for bootcamps for a while prior
          as becomeing a developer was something I was wanting to explore, but the fear of the cost, the potential unemployment period and of failure always held me back. With the added stress of the pandemic which caused many bootcamps to shrink down or even disappear,
          I was terrified. Thankfully I found Turing during one of my searches and learned they took the GI Bill, which assuaged my fears of cost and debt. I had the most amazing time at Turing, the courses were fleshed out,
          the instructors very capable with real world experience I feel I am completely prepared to finally, fully and completely enter the world of developers

          I have over 11 years of experience in fast-paced IT support and high-level service desk knowledge. Working closely with both customers and developers, I’ve gained the ability to see a product from 
          both perspectives—understanding user needs while thinking critically about technical solutions. I want to work for a company that values its employees and customers, strives for excellence, and 
          maintains a sustainable environment with a vision for the future.<br><br>
          Like many others, I’ve always dreamed of making games. Seeing the incredible advancements in game development today fills me with excitement for the future. 
          Whether at a startup or an established company, my goal is to contribute to building great products that engage and inspire. As long as I’m creating something meaningful, I know I will succeed.
